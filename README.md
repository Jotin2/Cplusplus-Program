# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I was required to make a clock that displays both 12-hr and 24-hr time. The clock should be able to be change its time via user input, and reflect those changes in both the 12-hr and 24-hr time clocks. 

# What did you do particularly well?
What I thought that I did well was formatting the two clocks so that there were always equal spacing between the borders and the numbers.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The original prompt of this project was to make it so you can wait for user input in real time while updating the time of the clock at the same time. This could only be done if threading was implemented which I do not know how to do yet. This would improve the design of this project by a significant amount as the user can see the clock update in real time while it is waiting for an input.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The part that was most challenging to write was formatting the clock in the proper way. I had to use setw() function in order to format the clocks so there were equal spacing. Coding the clock itself was pretty straightforward.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Knowing how to create a class and implementing it in a project would transfer to any other projects, as most projects requires you to create a class in order to complete the project. Also, knowing how to modularize the code makes it much cleaner and easier to read, which is also another skill that would be helpful in other projects.


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding comments and made it modularized. By commenting the code, it makes it much easier to read and maintain. By having the code modularized, it makes it adaptable as well as the other two.
